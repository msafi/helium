# Helium

It's a blogging app that only requires Amazon S3 and Amazon IAM for its back-end. Using those two services, this blogging app is able to work like any other blogging app. You have an admin area where you can write and edit posts and manage settings, etc.
 
You can check out my Helium blog [here](http://mk-helium-blog.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/#!/). I'll create another demo soon where you can also try out the back-end.

If you're interested in creating your own Helium blog, see the [installation guide](wiki/Installation-guide).

If you're interested in learning more about how it works, see the [concepts documentation](wiki/concepts).
