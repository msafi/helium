# Helium

It's a blogging app that only requires Amazon S3 and Amazon IAM for its back-end. Using those two services, this blogging app is able to work like any other blogging app. You can authenticate yourself safely as an admin to write and edit posts and manage settings, etc.

You can check out my Helium blog [here](http://mk-helium-blog.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/#!/). I'll create another demo soon where you can also try out the back-end.

## To-do:

* Back-end demo blog
* [Installation guide](https://github.com/msafi/helium/wiki/Installation-guide)
* [Concepts documentation](https://github.com/msafi/helium/wiki/concepts)
