# Helium

It's a blogging app that, basically, only requires Amazon S3 for its back-end. Yet, it is able to work like any other blogging platform. You can authenticate yourself as the admin in order to write and edit posts and manage settings, etc.

You can check out my Helium blog [here](http://mk-helium-blog.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/#!/). I'll create another demo where you can also try out the back-end later.
