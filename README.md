# Helium

Helium is a blogging app that's coded entirely in AngularJS. For the back-end, it uses Amazon S3. For authentication, it uses Amazon Identity & Access Management (IAM) and Google Login. For unauthenticated access by blog readers, it uses Amazon Cognito.

The entire app is available in one file: `dist/index.html`. You upload this file to your Amazon S3 account, do some configurations, and you will have a blog with infinite and hassle-free scale. And you only pay for your Amazon S3 traffic. All the other services are free.

The current features of Helium are:

* Authenticated admin: login & logout
* Manage posts: create, edit, and delete
* Write posts in Markdown

While the code has complete unit test coverage, the application isn't ready for prime time. For example, there's no pagination and the homepage is slow to load due to the number of HTTP requests that need to be made. But this all can be fixed! 

## Proof of concept

I have created Helium as a proof of concept because the benefits are significant:

* It is pleasant to use because the entire application is front-end code with interactive AngularJS UI
* It is cheap because the only cost is Amazon S3 traffic bill
* Since it's using Amazon S3, it inherits all the benefits of Amazon S3, such as automatic back-ups, versioning, and the ability to handle infinite amount of traffic
* Amazon CDN, CloudFront, can easily be integrated for performance
* Using Amazon IAM Web Identity Federation, all of Amazon services are available to the admin, so sending emails and scheduling tasks are also possible
* Despite using a very light technology stack, it can support all the essential features that a full-stack system, like WordPress, supports
* The user owns both the platform and the content
* It's easy to create a web service that installs and configures a unique Helium instance for an end-user. The user would just need an AWS account and have registered Google Login project 

## Try it out

If you'd like to try it out, I've set up a demo blog where you can [login](http://helium-dev.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/#!/login) with your Google account to access the admin menu and create new posts, etc.

Or you can follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/msafi/helium/wiki/Install-Helium) if you want your own Helium blog.

## Development

If you'd like to try or develop the app locally, do this:

* Clone the repo
* `npm i & bower i` in the root
* `npm i` in `server/`
* `grunt develop` in the root to start the server. Then load the app at `http://localhost:8000/`

Even though the app will run locally, it'll still communicate with Amazon S3 to save and retrieve posts. Any saved posts or objects will get purged within 24 hours.

You can also use `grunt test` to run unit tests or `grunt coverage` to both run unit tests and get a test coverage report.

## Thanks

To Alex Craig from App Advice for constantly pushing me to explore new platforms and services, which opened my eyes to the possibility of integrating these services to create a lightweight blogging app.
